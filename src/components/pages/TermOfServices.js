        This notice sets out how we use and protect your personal information...

      <p>We are Top Travel, an online travel agency.</p>

      <h2 className="privacy-policy-header">Making a booking</h2>

      <p className="privacy-text">
        When you book through us, both online or over the phone via one of our
        agents, you need to provide certain information such as your name,
        address, e-mail, phone number and payment. If you happen to fill in the
        booking pages but for some reason donâ€™t actually complete the booking,
        you will still have provided us with your information. If relevant to
        your booking, or the service you need, we may also collect medical
        information and any special dietary or disability requests (for example
        when you complete a special assistance form). We use your personal
        information and financial and other information you provide to make the
        booking, including flights, hotels, transport, insurance and other
        extras. Where necessary, we will use your personal information to access
        your bookings so that we can view, manage and make any changes to your
        booking, and give you notice of any cancellations or changes. Where
        there have been cancellations, we use your information to process and
        manage refund requests. We will also need to monitor the status of (and
        handle correspondence in connection with) your bookings, for example, to
        deal with and monitor and send on to you communications from your
        airline, hotel or other relevant third party relating to any
        rescheduling or other changes. We also need to use certain information
        about you and your party to pay for your booking, including, where
        relevant, payment details and/or redeeming vouchers. To effectively
        manage your booking with some of the service providers (such as certain
        airlines), it may be necessary for us to create an additional user
        account on your behalf with those service providers.
