        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This notice sets out how we use and protect your personal
          information...
        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">Who we are</h3>
        <p>We are Top Travel, an online travel agency.</p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">Making a booking</h3>

        <p className="privacy-text">
          When you book through us, both online or over the phone via one of our
          agents, you need to provide certain information such as your name,
          address, e-mail, phone number and payment. If you happen to fill in
          the booking pages but for some reason don’t actually complete the
          booking, you will still have provided us with your information. If
          relevant to your booking, or the service you need, we may also collect
          medical information and any special dietary or disability requests
          (for example when you complete a special assistance form). We use your
          personal information and financial and other information you provide
          to make the booking, including flights, hotels, transport, insurance
          and other extras. Where necessary, we will use your personal
          information to access your bookings so that we can view, manage and
          make any changes to your booking, and give you notice of any
          cancellations or changes. Where there have been cancellations, we use
          your information to process and manage refund requests. We will also
          need to monitor the status of (and handle correspondence in connection
          with) your bookings, for example, to deal with and monitor and send on
          to you communications from your airline, hotel or other relevant third
          party relating to any rescheduling or other changes. We also need to
          use certain information about you and your party to pay for your
          booking, including, where relevant, payment details and/or redeeming
          vouchers. To effectively manage your booking with some of the service
          providers (such as certain airlines), it may be necessary for us to
          create an additional user account on your behalf with those service
          providers.
        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">
          Communicating with you about your booking
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you contact us, by phone, SMS, email, or by another method, we’ll
          ask you to provide certain information for security purposes and to
          ensure that we are dealing with the right booking. This is likely to
          include your name, address, email address and phone number so we can
          respond to you appropriately. Where we need to contact you, we’ll
          contact you using the email or phone number you provided to give you
          information relevant to your booking. For example, to confirm your
          booking, tell you about any changes, security alerts or to send
          administrative messages about your arrangements and reminders. These
          messages are different from marketing messages. For information about
          marketing communications.
        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">Customer Services</h3>
        <p>
          If you contact our Customer Services team we will use your personal
          information to respond to and deal with any complaint, query or
          request you make. As part of our customer care procedures, we may also
          follow up by letter, phone, SMS, email, or through social media with
          customers who have travelled with us, for example, to solve a
          complaint or to ask for a review. Our Customer Services team may need
          to contact you, for example, to call you if your booking requires
          additional assistance, or if there is an issue. You can contact us at
          any time, whether this is a general query, a question about your
          booking or to report an issue. You can do this through Manage My
          Booking on our website, by using the phone or through social media.
          We’ll use the information you’ve given us, and information we already
          have about your current or previous booking, to answer any questions
          and respond to your query or other queries you might have in the
          future. Our chat function requires you to provide certain information
          to verify your identity to make sure it provides accurate responses
          before we put you through to a member of our customer services team.
          We record phone calls and monitor them for the following reasons:{" "}
          <ul className="container-list">
            <li>
              As a record of the holiday contract and what was agreed or
              included.
            </li>
            <li>
              Quality control: to make sure customer service staff are
              responding appropriately and following our processes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Analytics: to understand the nature and volume of calls to better
              manage Customer Services, and to be alerted to any serious or
              repeated issues.{" "}
            </li>
            <li>Staff training.</li>
            <li>
              To protect us if there is a legal dispute and / or in connection
              with our third-party supplier processing
            </li>
            <li>
              To improve our day-to-day services and to prevent fraud, other
              crimes, and misuse of services
            </li>
          </ul>{" "}
          This helps us to make sure you can safely use our services. We keep
          the call recordings only for a limited period, and on our own internal
          systems, and then automatically delete them, unless we’ve got a
          legitimate interest in keeping them for a longer period and that is
          not overridden by your rights. We also use your personal information,
          including previous purchases and preferences, to provide you with a
          more streamlined and improved service, such as to help suggest
          alternative hotel and flight selections if your original selection is
          cancelled.
        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">Marketing</h3>
        <p>
          You can opt into marketing communications, price and deal alerts on
          our websites. When you make a booking, we will ask you if you would
          like to receive marketing communications. You can opt out of marketing
          communications at any time. For more information see the section in
          this policy on ‘Objection to Marketing’. If you have agreed to
          marketing we will contact you with information about our products and
          services that are similar to those that you have already purchased or
          enquired about and we think may interest you based on your personal
          information or profile. Don’t worry, you can opt out of marketing
          communications at any time. Where you are subscribed to any price or
          deal alerts, you can turn these off at any time. Of course, the choice
          is yours, but if you do choose not to receive marketing information
          from us this will prevent you from receiving great offers or
          promotions that may be of interest to you. Opting out of marketing or
          turning off alerts won’t affect the service-related communications you
          get from us, for example, to confirm your booking, tell you about any
          changes, security alerts, administrative messages about your
          arrangements and reminders. We may use your personal information to
          generate targeted marketing on various social media sites, including,
          but not limited to, Facebook. The relevant social media provider will
          be responsible for your personal information in respect of any
          targeted marketing it carries out on our behalf and will be able to
          tell you more about how they use and process your personal
          information. We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices,
          terms and conditions and preference settings that are available to you
          on social media platforms. If you do not want to receive such targeted
          advertising generally, you can switch this off on the social media
          site. If you do not want to receive such targeted advertising from us,
          please contact us on{" "}

        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">Security</h3>
        <p>
          We may use your data as part of the efforts to keep our websites (and
          the information you provide to us) safe and secure, and to prevent
          fraud or unauthorised access / use of our websites and / or your user
          account on our websites.
        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">Fraud</h3>
        <p>
          We may use your personal information provided along with other
          publicly available information (including on social media) and
          information provided to us by third parties to prevent or detect any
          suspected fraud, or to prevent, detect or defend any claims / actions
          we believe to be potentially fraudulent or detrimental to our
          legitimate business interests.
        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">
          Legal and regulatory compliance
        </h3>
        <p>
          We might need to use your information in relation to any legal
          disputes, insurance claims, regulatory, compliance or criminal
          investigations, or if necessary to enforce our rights. This may
          include reviewing information which you have made publicly available
          and which may be relevant to any claim (including information
          available on social media sites). We may use your information to meet
          our regulatory obligations, including liaising with regulatory
          authorities and for our own internal audit purposes, to comply with
          applicable laws and regulations and to comply with lawful requests by
          public authorities, health authorities, discovery requests, or where
          otherwise required or permitted by applicable laws, court orders,
          government regulations, or regulatory authorities. We will use your
          personal data to comply with your requests to exercise your rights
          under data protection legislation.

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">
          Pandemics or other unexpected events
        </h3>
        <p>
          We might need to use your information in relation to managing your
          booking with us in the event of a pandemic or unexpected event, and/or
          to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.
        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">Business transaction</h3>
        <p>
          We might need to use your information for planning, due diligence and
          implementation in relation to a commercial transaction or service
          transfer that affects customers, for example, mergers and acquisitions
          or a sale of all or part of our business.
        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">
          Information you give to us about others in your party
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you’re booking with others or for someone else, you will have to
          give us their information as well, for example, their name and date of
          birth and, where relevant, if they need special assistance. It is your
          responsibility to make sure that they are aware that you have done so,
          that they agree to you sharing their information, and that they
          understand how we use and process their information as well as yours.
          Where you provide information on behalf of another traveller regarding
          any health or medical issues relevant to the booking, you will need to
          confirm that you have their consent to share this information. This
          will include processing of the information, providing it to service
          providers (such as airlines or hotels you have booked) and/or relevant
          health and/or government bodies if they require it.
        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">
          Special category personal information
        </h3>
        <p>
          With your consent, you may provide us with (or another person on your
          behalf may provide us with) special category information - also known
          as 'sensitive' personal information about: - your health (including
          with respect to any mental or physical health condition that may be
          relevant for your booking or query); - your sexual orientation (such
          as to ask us about our couples' holidays). By consenting to provide us
          with this information you are agreeing to our use of it to provide
          what you have requested. This includes providing information to
          service providers where needed, such as to arrange assistance at the
          airport, or to relevant health and government bodies if needed, such
          as in relation to a pandemic. Where another person has provided that
          information to us on your behalf, it is their responsibility to get
          your explicit consent to do so.
        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">Children’s information</h3>
        <p>
          You are only allowed to use this website or the app if you are over 18
          years of age. We only process information about children with the
          consent of the parents or legal guardians.
        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">
          How do we store your data and how long for?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We store information on secure servers and all payment transactions on
          our websites are encrypted. Only authorised staff are allowed to
          access your information. We’ll only keep your information for as long
          as we need it, to provide you with the products and services you have
          requested or booked, for our business accounts and records, to meet
          our legal and regulatory obligations, or for other legitimate business
          purposes. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process
          your personal data we will either delete or anonymise it. If this is
          not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
          stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
          information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion
          is possible. When you pay for your holiday on our website, or
          otherwise make a payment on our websites, we don’t store your full
          card details – instead we store the last 4 digits of the card and use
          an encrypted authorisation ‘token’ issued by your payment provider to
          collect the payment, or remaining payments if you chose to pay by
          instalments. We need to keep these details after you have paid as we
          are obliged to make any refunds or other payments that may be due back
          to the original payment card.
        </p>

        <h3 className="privacy-policy-header">Service providers</h3>
        <p>
          If you make a booking, we will need to share your booking data with
          the relevant service providers to complete your booking contract, such
          as the hotel you're booking to stay at or the flights or transfers
          you've selected or any other components you have selected as part of
          your holiday booking. Sometimes there will be more than one service
          provider in the chain (for example where a hotel booking is booked
          through another provider representing a number of hotels). We may need
          to share your financial information with certain third parties to buy
          the relevant services from them on your behalf. The data shared may
          include your name and the names and ages of any guests travelling with
          you, any preferences or special requests you told us about when you
          made your booking and your contact details. If you contact us with a
          query about your booking, we may pass this on to the relevant service
          providers if their assistance is needed to answer you. Where required,
          and where we have your consent (or another legal basis under data
          protection legislation) to do so, we may provide information about
          your health or the health of members of your party. We will take all
          reasonable steps to make sure your data is passed on securely but once
          it is with the service providers, it is their responsibility.
